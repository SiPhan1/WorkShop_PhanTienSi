# HYBRID DNS MANAGEMENT WITH ROUTE 53  
## INTEGRATING AWS AND ON-PREMISES DNS SYSTEMS

---

### Overview

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to designing, deploying, and managing a **Hybrid DNS architecture** using AWS Route 53 and on-premises DNS infrastructure.

The architecture includes features such as **conditional forwarding**, **split-horizon DNS**, **monitoring with CloudWatch**, and **disaster recovery (DR)** support.

---

### Key Capabilities

- **Two-way DNS resolution** between AWS and on-premises
- **Conditional forwarding rules** for specific domain zones
- **Split-horizon DNS** with private and public hosted zones
- **Monitoring with CloudWatch & DNS query logs**
- **GuardDuty integration** for DNS threat detection
- **Operational procedures** and **troubleshooting runbooks**
- **Disaster recovery setup** with Route 53 health checks
