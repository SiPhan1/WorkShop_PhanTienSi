# HYBRID DNS MANAGEMENT WITH ROUTE 53

---

## Why Hybrid DNS?

Modern enterprises increasingly adopt hybrid cloud architectures — combining on-premises infrastructure with cloud services. One critical challenge in this setup is **name resolution**: ensuring that resources in AWS and on-premises networks can resolve each other’s domain names reliably, securely, and efficiently.

A traditional DNS setup often breaks in hybrid environments due to mismatched name zones, routing complexities, and security boundaries.

## Objective of This Guide

This documentation provides a hands-on approach to **building a hybrid DNS architecture** using Amazon Route 53 Resolver, with key goals:

- Enable **bidirectional name resolution** between AWS and on-premises  
- Ensure **split-horizon DNS** for public/private zone isolation  
- Implement **conditional forwarding rules** for fine-grained DNS control  
- Set up **monitoring** and **security alerting**  
- Provide **disaster recovery** via Route 53 health checks and failover  

This is ideal for teams needing to bridge their on-prem DNS infrastructure with cloud-based workloads while maintaining compliance, performance, and observability.

## Key Design Components

- **Route 53 Inbound Resolver Endpoints** – Let on-prem DNS query AWS names  
- **Route 53 Outbound Resolver Endpoints** – Let AWS query on-prem DNS zones  
- **Private & Public Hosted Zones** – Support split-horizon DNS  
- **DNS Forwarding Rules** – Handle zone-specific resolution  
- **CloudWatch Logs** – Track DNS queries and behaviors  
- **GuardDuty DNS Protection** – Detect threats based on query patterns  

---

## Benefits in a Real-World Environment

- Seamless resolution across hybrid networks  
- DNS-based threat visibility and detection  
- Improved latency via optimized routing  
- Failover-ready architecture with health checks  
- Clear operational playbook for setup, validation, and troubleshooting

## What’s Inside

You’ll walk through each of these components, set up AWS and on-prem connectivity, and validate end-to-end DNS resolution. By the end, you’ll be equipped with a robust DNS solution suited for hybrid environments.
